# Store Management Application

This project is a store management application developed as part of a study project using the NET platform. The main focus of the project was on object-oriented programming and building a fully functional application for store management, as well as designing and building a UI in WPF.

## Technologies and Skills Utilized

Throughout the development process, we had the opportunity to learn and implement various technologies and skills, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for designing and building a modular and scalable application.
- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern for designing the user interface (UI) layer.
- Git version control for efficient collaboration and code management.
- Debugging techniques to identify and fix issues during the development phase.
- Working with multiple classes/interfaces to create a well-structured application.
- Implementing multi-threading to enable parallel processing.
- Utilizing design patterns to ensure clean and maintainable code.
- Time management and progress monitoring to meet tight deadlines.
- Leveraging online resources for research and learning.

## Project Highlights

The end result of this project is a fully functional store management application. Key features of the application include:

- Store Manager Features:
   - Efficient inventory management, including the ability to create new products and track shipments.
   - Streamlined inventory tracking and management functionalities.
- Customer Features:
   - User-friendly for creating and managing a shopping basket.
